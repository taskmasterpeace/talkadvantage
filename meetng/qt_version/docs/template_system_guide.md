# Template System Guide

## Overview

The PowerPlay template system allows you to create customized AI assistants for different conversation types. Templates control how the AI analyzes and responds to your conversations, providing specialized insights based on the conversation context.

## Template Components

Each template consists of several key components:

### 1. Basic Information
- **Name**: Unique identifier for the template
- **Description**: Brief explanation of the template's purpose and use case

### 2. Core Prompts
- **System Prompt**: Defines the AI's role, expertise, and behavior
- **User Prompt**: Provides context about your needs and perspective
- **Template Prompt**: Specifies the exact format and content of the analysis

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Conversation Mode**: Controls how the conversation is structured
- **Curiosity Prompt**: Customizes the questions generated by the Curiosity Engine
- **Bookmarks**: Special markers for important conversation elements
- **Visualization Settings**: Controls how the conversation is displayed

## Conversation Modes

The template system supports two conversation modes:

### Tracking Mode
- **Purpose**: Follow the natural flow of open-ended conversations
- **Best for**: Brainstorming sessions, exploratory discussions, informal meetings
- **Visualization**: Typically uses radial or force-directed layouts
- **Behavior**: Focuses on capturing the overall context and connections between topics

### Guided Mode
- **Purpose**: Direct conversations toward specific goals or outcomes
- **Best for**: Interviews, negotiations, structured meetings
- **Visualization**: Typically uses hierarchical layouts
- **Behavior**: Emphasizes question-answer relationships and decision points

## Special Bookmark Types

Bookmarks allow you to mark important elements in your conversations:

### User Speaking Markers
